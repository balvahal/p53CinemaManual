p53Cinema is a software package for semiautomatic tracking of individual cells in live cell imaging datasets. We developed the software while simultaneously using it to learn about the biology of individual cells. Thus, many of its features were tailored to address our interests as biologists. The software is useful to track a wide variety of cell lines, including fast moving cells. Further, we envision that it will prove valuable to generate gold-standard datasets to test and improve the accuracy of automated tracking algorithms. We hope that this is helpful for your work! If you use this for your research, please cite the paper where we first introduced this tracking method:
